                        In the scatter plot chart above, we are investigating the relationships between 
                        demographic information and health risk (poverty vs. tobacco use in particular).
                        The data collected was from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 
                        and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the year of 2014.
                        Each point in the scatter represents a state (hover over point for more information).
                        The scatter plot shows a positive correlation between rate of poverty and the
                        use of tobacco.   The trend shows that as rate of poverty increases, so does 
                        the rate of tobacco use.  Some of the southern states lead in the trend and that can
                        be explained by the affordability and acceptance of tobacco products whereas states like
                        New York and California have stricter laws of the use of tobacco and the heavy taxes on
                        tobacco products.  The outlier in this scatter plot would be Utah.  States with the similar
                        rate of poverty to Utah would have a 14% to 16% rate of tobacco use, whereas Utah's tobacco
                        use is the lowest of all 50 states (9.7%).  This can be explained by the huge Mormon population
                        in Utah.
