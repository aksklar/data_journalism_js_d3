# Data Journalism with JavaScript D3 and SVG

The premise of this project was to investigate the relationship between demographic information (from U.S. Census) and health risk (from C.D.C) by creating a data visulization with JavaScript and D3.  The topic I chose to investigate was the correlation between poverty and the use of tobacco in the United States.  After collecting and cleaning the data, I created a JavaScript file that housed the D3 script I wrote to produce a scatterplot.  Each point on the scatterplot represents a state and when the user hovers over the point, a tooltip will appear with details on the percentage of proverty that state has and the percentage of tobacco use by that state.
